This repository is for a code challenge that shows a slippy map that a user can zoom, pan and click on.  When clicking on the map it will download a imagery centered at the location you clicked on and display it.

Requires node installed on your system, you can get it here: http://www.nodejs.org

After you have installed nodejs we'll want to install all the dev dependencies by running "npm install".

NOTE that if you are running on a MAC insert "sudo" in front of every command.  On windows run the command prompt or power shell as an administrator. 

Now run the following commands below to get the latest version of bower.

npm rm bower -g

npm install bower -g
